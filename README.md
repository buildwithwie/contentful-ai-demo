# Contentful AI Workflow Simulation (Portfolio Demo)

This project demonstrates **three simulated AI workflows** inside Contentful:  
1. Alt Text (Accessibility & SEO)  
2. Rewrite / Tone Adjustment (Content Refinement)  
3. SEO Optimization (Metadata)  

Although some AI Actions are premium-only, I designed workflows and prompts that simulate how they would be applied in real scenarios.  
This aligns directly with the responsibilities of an **AI Product Manager** — improving accessibility, accelerating content workflows, and ensuring discoverability at scale.

## 🔹 1. Alt Text Workflow (Accessibility & SEO)

**Capture A1 (Before alt text)**  
- Image asset had no description or alt text.  

**Capture A2 (After alt text)**  
- Simulated AI alt text workflow:  
  > *"Flat illustration showing marketers collaborating with AI-powered workflows on digital screens."*  

**Capture A3 (After Published)**  
- Published the simulated AI alt text into the Contentful entry.  

**Impact:**  
- Improved accessibility for screen readers.  
- Enhanced SEO by making assets more discoverable.

## 🔹 2. Rewrite / Tone Adjustment Workflow (Content Refinement)

**Capture B1 (Text before Rewrite)**  
- Body text (original copy):  
  > *"Our platform helps companies create digital content. It makes the process faster and easier for teams."*  

**Capture B2 (Text after Rewrite)**  
- Prompt (AI Simulation):  
  *“Rewrite this copy in a concise, on-brand, marketing tone.”*  
- After (AI-style rewrite):  
  > *"Create and publish digital content effortlessly — faster, smarter, and at scale."*  

**Capture B3 (Text after rewrite + status Published)**  
- Entry published with rewritten copy.  

**Capture B4 (Preview text after rewrite)**  
- Verified changes in **Contentful Live Preview** to confirm rewritten on-brand copy was instantly reflected on the Marketing Website template.  

**Impact:**  
- Copy adapted to a more engaging, on-brand style.  
- Demonstrates how AI-assisted rewrites refine messaging and save time for marketing teams.

## 🔹 3. SEO Optimization Workflow (Metadata)

**Capture C1 (Before SEO optimization)**  
- Homepage was missing SEO metadata → search engines would fallback to default titles.  

**Capture C2 (After SEO optimization - Published)**  
- Created and published a custom SEO entry (*Homepage SEO – AI Workflow Demo*).  
- Optimized fields:  
  - **SEO Title:** *"Build Personalized Digital Experiences with AI Workflows"*  
  - **SEO Description:**  
    *"Empower your team with composable content and AI workflows. Build personalized, on-brand experiences at scale with confidence."*  

**Capture C3 (After with SEO metadata)**  
- Linked SEO metadata entry to Homepage.  
- Verified published status.  

**Impact:**  
- Improved search engine ranking and keyword alignment.  
- Ensured the website is channel-ready and discoverable.
